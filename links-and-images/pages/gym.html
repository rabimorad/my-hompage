    <h3>Gym is a Lifestyle</h3>
    <p>I have been going to gym since 2012 to get in shape and I always workout alone because I like to take my time to 
        focus on my bodyparts. I also got unmotivated because of putting so much time in the gym and expected to get quick results very fast, 
        but there is no shortcuts to lose weigth or build muscle. Everything is about what you eating when you try to get result.  
        If you go to gym without a plan that makes everything boring and you don't feel motivated, you need to dedicate yourself 
        for weightlifting and try to ask your self about your goals, how much does it take o get there. Arnold Schwarsnegger is a huge inspiration 
        since i was a child always wanted to look like him but you need to live like him also and spend fulltime in the gym.
